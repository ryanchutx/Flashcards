## Flashcards

## Lab 1

### App Description
This application was created for Codepath's Lab 1, where we were tasked to create a barebones flashcards app that would display an answer to a question. In this project, there is one question ("Where is the U.S. Capitol located?"), and the answer is revealed when the user taps the flashcard.
