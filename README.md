## Flashcards

## Lab 3

### App Description
In Lab 3, my Flashcards app added functionality to create an array of flashcards that a user could navigate backwards and forwards through. In addition, the ability to save existing cards to disk and read them from disk allows users to continue studying their flashcards from where they left off without missing a beat.

## Lab 2

### App Description
In Lab 2, my Flashcards app added the extra functionality to create a new custom flashcard by passing in user-generated data. To do this, a new "+" button was added to the bottom of the main screen which brings the user to a creation modal, allowing users to input their own question and answer.

## Lab 1

### App Description
This application was created for Codepath's Lab 1, where we were tasked to create a barebones flashcards app that would display an answer to a question. In this project, there is one question ("Where is the U.S. Capitol located?"), and the answer is revealed when the user taps the flashcard. In addition to the required tasks, I also modified the corner radius/shadows on the question card, and added multiple choice answers beneath the card.
