## Flashcards

## Lab 2

### App Description
In Lab 2, my Flashcards app added the extra functionality to create a new custom flashcard by passing in user-generated data. To do this, a new "+" button was added to the bottom of the main screen which brings the user to a creation modal, allowing users to input their own question and answer.

## Lab 1

### App Description
This application was created for Codepath's Lab 1, where we were tasked to create a barebones flashcards app that would display an answer to a question. In this project, there is one question ("Where is the U.S. Capitol located?"), and the answer is revealed when the user taps the flashcard. In addition to the required tasks, I also modified the corner radius/shadows on the question card, and added multiple choice answers beneath the card.
